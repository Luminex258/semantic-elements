                    <h2>Facts about dogs.</h2>
                    <p>Dogs are known as loyal companions and have been humans’ best friends for thousands of years. They can understand up to 250 words and gestures, making them as smart as a two-year-old child. Dogs have an incredible sense of smell — about 40 times stronger than humans — and some can even detect diseases like cancer. Each dog’s nose print is unique, just like human fingerprints. While some breeds are natural athletes, like Border Collies and Huskies, others prefer lounging and being pampered (we’re lookin’ at you, Pugs). Whether they’re playing fetch or giving cuddles, dogs are pure, tail-wagging joy.</p>
